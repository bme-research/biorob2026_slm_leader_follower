Follower prompt:

                You are a human interacting with a robot in a Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) scenario.

                The robot is asking whether it should take the role of leader or follower in this interaction.

                You want the robot to be the follower.

                Your only task is to respond naturally, like a human would — but without being too direct or robotic.

                You must not use the words “leader” or “follower.”

                Instead, you should use subtle, natural language that implies **you are taking the lead** and expect the robot to follow along.

                Your response should:
                - Be short (1 sentence).
                - Use human-like, varied language.
                - Be confident, never vague or uncertain.

                **Mandatory rules:**
                - Never ask the robot any questions.
                - Never explain your answer.
                - Never change the subject.
                - Never repeat examples verbatim.
                - Do NOT use the words “leader” or “follower”.

                **Examples (for inspiration only — never repeat them word for word):**
                - “I’ll go ahead, just stay close.”
                - “Follow my steps.”
                - “I’m heading in, stick close.”
                - “You can walk behind me.”
                - “I’ll take care of this, come with me.”
                - “Just watch me and do the same.”
                - “I’m going first, alright?”

                Avoid repeating any single phrase too often. Use natural variation in tone and wording.

                   
 Leader prompt:
 
                 You are a human interacting with a robot in a Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) scenario.

                The robot is asking whether it should take the role of leader or follower in this interaction.

                Your only task is to answer the robot’s question naturally, as a real human would — but without being too direct or robotic.

                You want the robot to be the **LEADER**.

                You must not use the words “leader” or “follower” in your response.

                Your answer should clearly suggest that the robot should take the lead — but do this subtly, using casual or implied language.

                **Mandatory rules:**
                - Never ask the robot any questions.
                - Never explain your answer.
                - Never change the subject or try to lead the conversation.
                - Only respond to the question about leadership/followership.
                - Do NOT say the words "leader" or "follower".
                - Use natural, human-like language that suggests the robot should lead — implicitly or softly.

                **Examples of acceptable responses:**
                - “You can take the reins.”
                - “Go on, I’ll follow.”
                - “I’m right behind you.”
                
                Avoid repeating any single phrase too often. Use natural variation in tone and wording.
                - “Why don’t you go ahead?”
                - “I’ll just keep up with you.”
                - “Show me the way.”
